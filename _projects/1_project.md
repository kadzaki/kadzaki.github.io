[INKAD COVID 19 IntelliSearch](https://apps.ump.ma/inkadsearch) is an intelligent search engine designed and developed by the AIRES team of the LaRSA laboratory at Oujda's National School of Applied Sciences, as part of a call for projects related to the COVID 19 pandemic launched by the CNRST.

The aim of this intelligent search engine is to help Moroccan researchers keep abreast of developments in COVID 19 research. The researchers who will be directly concerned are biologists and physicians, particularly virologists and infectiologists, as well as social science researchers.

This search engine currently contains over 200,000 scientific articles relating to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and other diseases in the coronavirus family.
