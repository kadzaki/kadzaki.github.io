I am currently an assistant professor at the National School of Artificial Intelligence and Digital (ENIAD), Berkane, Morocco. In the Past, I was a Computer Science instructor at [OFPPT](https://ofppt.ma), and before that, I was a software engineer at [SQLI](https://www.sqli.com). I completed my PhD under the supervision of Prof. [Toumi Bouchentouf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bouchentouf-Toumi-3) in the Computer Science Department at the National School of Applied Sciences (ENSA) Oujda. Long time back, I graduated in 2010 with an engineering degree in Computer Science from ENSA, Oujda.

My PhD research focused on advancing the state-of-the-art of Question Answering (QA) systems in the biomedical domain. Mainly, the use of Large Biomedical Language Models in a QA setting over biomedical text.

As part of my computer science research in the LaRSA lab at ENSA Oujda, I am primarily interested in Artificial intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Biomedical LLMs.
